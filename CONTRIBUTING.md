# Contribution Guide

## Bug Reports

For bug reports [submit an issue](https://github.com/PilotDataPlatform/notification/issues).

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the [main repository](https://github.com/PilotDataPlatform/notification).
2. Create a feature branch to hold your changes.
3. Work on the changes in your feature branch.
4. Add [Unit Tests](#unit-tests).
5. Follow the Getting Started instruction to set up the service.
6. Create the Alembic [migration](#migrations) environment only when it's needed.
7. Test the code and create a pull request.

### Migrations

Migrations should run automatically on `docker-compose up`. They can also be manually triggered:

```
docker compose run --rm alembic upgrade head
```

New migrations can be created with Alembic as well:

```
poetry install alembic
docker compose run --rm alembic revision -m "migration_name"
```

### Unit Tests

When adding a new feature or fixing a bug, unit tests are necessary to write. We use Pytest as our testing framework and all test cases are written under the `tests` directory.

Some services may need extra dependencies to run tests. Example:

```
docker run redis
```

Run test cases with Poetry and Pytest:

```
poetry run pytest
```
